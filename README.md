# Ocular-Disease-Classification-and-Clustering-
This repository contains the code for the data preprocessing, model training and model evaluation of the Convolutional Neural Network and K-Means Clustering models I used to classify and cluster ocular diseases present within fundus images. Two datasets have been used for this research: Ocular Disease Recognition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k) and eye_diseases_classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification). 3 supervised model architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121 and VGG16) and 1 unsupervised model (K-Means Clustering) have been trained.
